A simple physics game by Segolen Plihon.

Experience requirements:
The game uses both continuous and discreate inputs from the player by the player moving the bar and the ball bouncing off of the objects around it.

The player's goal can only be achieved indirectly by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position and contact as the ball movements can not be controlled by the player.

There are 3 physics-based gameplay scenes for the three levels for the Brick Breaker game. And other scenes used to seperate and contextulize the gameplay scenes such as the cover, game over, and game complete.

Asset sources:
All of the image assets were created by me through using procreate.

Code sources:
I took inspiration and referenced ... Editing and rewriting sections by me.
