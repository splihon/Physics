A simple physics game by Segolen Plihon.

Link to live site: https://splihon.github.io/Physics/

Experience requirements:
The game uses both continuous and discreate inputs from the player by the player controlling the direction of the bar with their mouse, and the ball bouncing off of the objects around it on the scene at its own velocity.

The player's goal can only be achieved indirectly by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position as the ball movements can not be controlled by the player.

There are 3 physics-based gameplay scenes. In this game these are the the three levels for the Brick Breaker game. The other scenes used to seperate and contextulize the gameplay scenes are the cover, result level 1, result level 2, game over, and game complete.

Asset sources:
All of the image assets were created by me through using procreate.

Code sources:
I took inspiration and referenced code from src/games/breakout/breakout.js. Editing and rewriting sections by me.
